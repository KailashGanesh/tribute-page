                Who are you talking to right now? Who is it you think you see? ...Do
                you know how much I make a year? I mean, even if I told you, you
                wouldn't believe it. Do you know what would happen if I suddenly decided
                to stop going to work? A business big enough that it could be listed on
                the NASDAQ goes belly up; disappears, it ceases to exist without me. No,
                you clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I
                am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger. A guy opens his door and gets
                shot and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks!
