        you know how much I make a year? I mean, even if I told you, you
        wouldn't believe it. Do you know what would happen if I suddenly decided
        to stop going to work? A business big enough that it could be listed on
        the NASDAQ goes belly up; disappears, it ceases to exist without me. No,
        you clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I
        am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger. A guy opens his door and gets
        shot and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks!"
        â€• Walt telling Skyler who he is
